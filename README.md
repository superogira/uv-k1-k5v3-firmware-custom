# F4HWN firmware port for the UV-K1 and UV-K5 V3 using the PY32F071 MCU

This repository is a fork of the [F4HWN custom firmware](https://github.com/armel/uv-k5-firmware-custom), who was a fork of [Egzumer custom firmware](https://github.com/egzumer/uv-k5-firmware-custom). It extends the work done for the UV-K5 V1, based on the DP32G030 MCU, and adapts it to the newer UV-K1 and UV-K5 V3 built around the PY32F071 MCU. It is the result of the joint work of [@muzkr](https://github.com/muzkr) and [@armel](https://github.com/armel).

A big thanks to DualTachyon, who paved the way by releasing the very first open-source [firmware](https://github.com/DualTachyon/uv-k5-firmware) for the UV-K5 V1. None of this would have been possible without that initial work !

# A note for developers who intend to fork this project

This firmware is distributed under the Apache 2.0 License, carrying forward the original copyright of DualTachyon, whose work laid the foundation for the UV-K5 open-source ecosystem.
If you create a fork or a derived version, **we strongly encourage you to keep your work open source**.

Keeping your fork open:

- aligns with the intent and spirit of the Apache 2.0 License
- supports the amateur-radio and embedded-development community
- avoids unnecessary fragmentation
- allows others to study, audit and improve the firmware

It is also very much in line with the **ham spirit**: sharing knowledge, experimenting together and helping each other, rather than closing things off or claiming them as your own.

Maintaining an open-source fork is the best way to help build a healthy and sustainable ecosystem for everyone.

 ## Manual

Up to date manual is available in the [Wiki section](https://github.com/armel/uv-k5-firmware-custom/wiki)

## Radio performance

Please note that the Quansheng UV-Kx radios are not professional quality transceivers, their
performance is strictly limited. The RX front end has no track-tuned band pass filtering
at all, and so are wide band/wide open to any and all signals over a large frequency range.

Using the radio in high intensity RF environments will most likely make reception anything but
easy (AM mode will suffer far more than FM ever will), the receiver simply doesn't have a
great dynamic range, which results in distorted AM audio with stronger RX'ed signals.
There is nothing more anyone can do in firmware/software to improve that, once the RX gain
adjustment I do (AM fix) reaches the hardwares limit, your AM RX audio will be all but
non-existent (just like Quansheng's firmware).
On the other hand, FM RX audio will/should be fine.

But, they are nice toys for the price, fun to play with.

## Compiling and Building from Docker

This project provides a Docker-based build system to compile all firmware editions for the UV-K1 and UV-K5 V3. Everything is handled through the `compile-with-docker.sh` helper script.

All build outputs are generated inside the `build/<Preset>` directory, according to the CMake presets defined in `CMakePresets.json`.

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system
- Bash environment (Linux, macOS, WSL, Git Bash on Windows)

### Build Script Overview

The script `compile-with-docker.sh` performs the following actions:

1. Builds the Docker image (`uvk1-uvk5v3`) if it does not already exist.
2. Removes any previous `build` directory to ensure a clean configuration.
3. Runs CMake using the selected preset inside the Docker container.
4. Builds the firmware and outputs `.elf`, `.bin` and `.hex` files for the chosen edition.

### Usage

```bash
./compile-with-docker.sh <Preset> [extra CMake options]
```

### Available Presets

- **Custom**
- **Bandscope**
- **Broadcast**
- **Basic**
- **RescueOps**
- **Game**
- **Fusion**
- **All** (builds all editions sequentially)

### Examples

Build a single edition:

```bash
./compile-with-docker.sh Fusion
./compile-with-docker.sh Bandscope
./compile-with-docker.sh Broadcast
```

Build everything:

```bash
./compile-with-docker.sh All
```

### Passing Additional CMake Options

You can pass extra configuration options after the preset name.  
These are forwarded directly to `cmake --preset` inside the container.

Examples:

```bash
./compile-with-docker.sh Bandscope -DENABLE_SPECTRUM=ON
./compile-with-docker.sh Broadcast -DENABLE_FEAT_F4HWN_GAME=ON -DENABLE_NOAA=ON
./compile-with-docker.sh Bandscope -DSQL_TONE=600
```

### Notes

- The first run may take a few minutes while Docker builds the base image.
- Running with `All` will build every firmware variant in sequence.
- Each build runs inside Docker, so your host environment remains clean.

## Flashing the Firmware with UVTools2

You can flash the UV-K5 V3 and UV-K1 directly from your web browser using the cross-platform WebSerial-based [UVTools2](https://armel.github.io/uvtools2/).

It works on Chrome, Chromium and Edge (desktop versions), and does not require installing any driver or software on your computer.

## Steps to flash the firmware

- Open UVTools2 in [flash](https://armel.github.io/uvtools2/?mode=flash) mode (or click the Flash Firmware tab).
- Connect your radio to your computer using a compatible USB programming cable (USB-C or Baofeng/Kenwood like double jack USB cable).
- Make sure your radio is in **DFU mode (flash mode)**.
- Select the firmware .bin file on your computer. 
- Click on `Flash Firmware`, then select the serial port associated with your radio.
- The progress bar will guide you through the flashing steps.

Once finished, your radio restart with the new firmware.

## Steps to dump or restore calibration data

[UVTools2](https://armel.github.io/uvtools2/) can also dump and restore calibration data, which is highly recommended. It’s best to create a dump right after installing F4HWN firmware, and to restore it before installing another firmware (or when returning to the stock firmware, for example).

### Dump

- Open UVTools2 in [dump](https://armel.github.io/uvtools2/?mode=dump) mode (or click the Dump Calib tab).
- Power on your radio in **normal mode**.
- Click `Dump Calibration Data`.

When the process is complete, click `Download calibration.dat` to save the file to your computer.

> [!NOTE]
> A good practice is to rename your calibration file using the serial number of your radio, which you can find on the label on the back of the device once you remove the battery. This helps avoid mixing up calibration files when you own multiple units.

### Restore

- Open UVTools2 in [restore](https://armel.github.io/uvtools2/?mode=restore) mode (or click the Restore Calib tab).
- Power on your radio in **normal mode**.
- Select your calibration.dat file on your computer.

Click `Restore Calibration Data` and wait until the process fully completes.
